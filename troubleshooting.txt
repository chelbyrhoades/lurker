Troubleshooting | Lurker

This file was created in order to troubleshoot common problems with Lurker. 

As a developer, I had trouble with several python libraries because of my computer. I'm operating on a Mac.

****************************************
Error 1: No module Named requests: 
********v********************************
The biggest issue starting out was gettting the requests library to work. I would run my code and get an error message saying that 'No module Named requests'.
Although it was downloaded previously, the file could not find this library. 

So, I tried:
'sudo pip install requests'
in order to install requests. It didn't work.
I tried:
'pip uninstall requests' and reinstalled it. 
Didn't work. 

The problem I was running into was that I was using pip, not pip3. This version of pip is compatible with Python3. Once I updated pip3, the file was able to locate the requests library.

If Lurker is having this same issue, and the solution above doesn't work, here are a few links you can research that I used:
