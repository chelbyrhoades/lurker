Key Architecture Explanation:

This crawler implements:
1. Looking at a web address for specific links (text file types)
2. Making sure none of the links are disallowed.
3. Scanning all allowed text and performing tf/idf on it.
4. Generating a report

Data Structures used:

List : for storing urls
Deeper explanation:
	Lists can store objects in specific orders; making it easy to index and iterate over.

Dictionary : for storing the words and their document frequencies
Deeper explanation:
	Storing two separate lists, words and frequencies, into a dictionary structure implements the same as a hash table. You can search or sort these by key or value. I'm using this to store keys and values and then sorting by the values to find the top words with the largest document frequencies.
